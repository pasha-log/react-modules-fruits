# React Modules Fruits Exercise

## Description: 

This exercise from Springboard was meant for practicing exporting and importing in the ES2015 style. It has parts of a CRA skeleton, but it's not actually an create-react-app. 
There are three javascript files inside the *src/* folder. One has a couple of helper functions for picking a random item from an array and removing/returning a specific item from 
an array. The second file has an array of fruit emojis. The third contains a silly conversation between a customer and fruit salesman that involves the other two files. 

To install: 
```
npm i
```

To test: 
```
npm start
```

* Check inside the browser console to see the silly interaction that looks something this: 
```
I'd like one üçâ, please

Here you go: üçâ

Delicious! May I have another?

I'm sorry, we're all out. We have 14 left.
```
